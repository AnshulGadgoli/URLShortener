Long URLs are often difficult to share, remember, or store. They take up a lot of space, look messy, and can be impractical for social media, presentations, or print.

The goal of this project is to build a **simple, lightweight URL-shortening web application.**

It converts long URLs into short, easy-to-share versions, which allows users to optionally define a **custom slug** (example: `cutt.ly/myvideo`). It also generates a **QR code** for the shortened link, and SQLite stores each shortened URL with its details for record-keeping.
